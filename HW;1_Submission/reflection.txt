The burger that the fresh ChatGPT model generated was visually simple and not very in line and put together.
It relied on simple shapes like rectangles, ellipses, and arc to represent the various layers.
It went pretty minimal and had really easy to recognize elements, but lacked any kind of background or shadows.
The design fell a little flat and super cartoonish, very beginner to be honest.
The ramen bowl I made is alot more intricate. It has all the toppings, broth, shadows for depth, and there is texture on every element.
It is modern and polished and has a richer overall visual design, more realism.
