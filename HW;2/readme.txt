CHATGPT's generation was fairly simple and random.
It had elements that were slightly trasnparent though so that is a cool touch that I didnt think about. 
The ramen lets a user directly control, the CHATGPT version incoroprates only really random movement. 
Even with simple shapes, you can create super engaging and interactive art.
Alot of different approaches to creative coding but I love my little bowl of ramen!
