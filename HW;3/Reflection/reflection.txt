The AI-generated image is pretty cool. 
I used chat GPT to generate it simply because of ease, it being the AI engine we are already using. 
Ive used AI image generation alot before actually, specifically for artistic refernces if there is a cool position or concept im having a tough time rendering.
you are able to really hone in on the vibe and enegry you wnat an image to have, as well as aesthetic choice, like my Ramen cartoon clip art based image. 
One of the main reason I chose to use AI for the image was just because of convenience honestly, was too bored of digging through some stock images lol!
I think its ultimately super crazy how fast it can just generate a totally unique image.
All of that being said though, AI art absolutely has its limits. The image turned out solid, but if I wanted to get to something super specific I would most likley need to run through many different iterations before finding satisfaction.
I wonder where it pulls it influences from too, obvioulsy with no artist behind behind it theres a level of mystery.
Does it pull image references or does it have hte power to encode visual info so well that it can emulate essentially "Any" artistic style?
